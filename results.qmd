## Summary
Overall, our project was a success! We were able to meet our specs that we laid out in our proposal, and produced a system that let people arm wrestle with EMG sensors. 

TODO - images or video of people playing on demo day 

Our sensors were acting up on demo day, which was partly due to inoptimal quality of sensor pads and partly due to an amplifier design that didn't have enough flexibility. We know it was the sensors and not the ADC because we checked our ADC setup with potentiometers and it worked perfectly.


## Future Work
If we were to continue working on this project, it would be good to better characterize the EMG sensor outputs. We noticed as we were demoing the project that the amplification circuit worked well for Ellie, but not Daniel, presumably due to different resting skin voltages. Instead of a fixed 11k resistor on the instrumentation amp, we could have a 1k in series with a 10k potentiometer, letting us vary the gain from 10x-100x. Also, we could make a PCB for it so we have fewer connection issues (or, we could just buy the commercial version).
For the MCU, it would have been cleaner to use interrupts for the ADC instead of a timer. Also, it would have been nice to test and use the offset calculation function we started working on (which could additionally be used to enable a cheating mode if we wanted to put a finger on the scale).
For the FPGA, ???
