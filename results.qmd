{Video of Ket and Jason} (need video link)

Multiplayer mode in full display, as two fellow MicroPs students (Ket and Jason) wrestle under disco lights


{Video of potentiometer} (need video link)

Demonstration of FPGA and MCU properly displaying a controlled voltage input from two potentiometers, which are in place of the muscle sensors


{Video of working on leg} (need video link)

Demonstration of single player mode outputting full range with sensors attached to calf muscle


### Future directions for fpga

The design of the FPGA could be improved. After the SPI module, single and multiplayer processes are run in parallel and then multiplexed 
before the system output, however this multiplex could also be done earlier to reduce processing power. Another area of improvement is to 
write modules to individual select a single pixel and set it to a desired rgb value, which would allow for much more flexibility in the 
screens capability. For the purpose of our project, we did not need this funcionality.
